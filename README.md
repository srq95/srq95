## 👨‍💻 About Me

I'm a Full Stack Developer with strong experience in modern JavaScript technologies.

I specialize in building fast, scalable applications using React, Next.js, React Native and Node.js.

Most of my work involves building production systems, improving performance, and solving real-world problems — not just writing code.

I enjoy working on products where I can take ownership and make technical decisions that improve long-term stability.
